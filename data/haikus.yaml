  - "This URL's broken\nMuch like my will to debug\nLet's start from the top"
  - "Error four-oh-four\nThe page you seek is hiding\nWith my car keys, probably"
  - "The page has vanished\nLike my motivation on\nMonday mornings, friend"
  - "Click, click, click—nothing\nThe internet shrugs at you\nWelcome to the void"
